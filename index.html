<h1>Artemis 2</h1>

<p>The first crewed Artemis flight marks a key step toward long‑term return
 to the Moon and future missions to Mars. Artemis 2 will be the first mission to carry humans toward the moon since NASA's Apollo program ended in 1972. 
 It builds on the success of the uncrewed Artemis I in 2022, and 
 will demonstrate a broad range of capabilities needed on deep space missions. 
 The Artemis II test flight will be NASA’s first mission with crew 
 aboard the SLS Space Launch System) rocket and Orion spacecraft. 
 It will be a flyby not a landing. NASA has identified several potential launch dates, with the earliest currently targeted for March 2026 and additional opportunities stretching into April. Specific dates include March 6–9 and 
 March 11, with backup opportunities on April 1, April 3-6, and April 30.

<h2>The mission</h2>

<p>Artemis II is a test flight, meaning that its primary objective is to 
	demonstrate key systems that would be needed for a crewed mission to land on 
	the Moon. These systems include the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the 
	Orion capsule, deep-space life support and environmental controls, the crew capsules’s heat shield, and communications capabilities, among others. 
	<a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/artemis-ii-what-to-expect">More information</a></p>



<p>The mission is expected to take about 10 days to complete, including these 
key milestones:</p>

<ol>
<li>SLS launches and carries Orion into Earth orbit.</li>
<li>Orion orbits Earth twice to test systems </li>
<li>The spacecraft heads toward the Moon</li>
<li>The crew travels around the Moon, getting as close as 8,000 kilometers 
(5,000 miles) from the lunar surface</li>
<li>The spacecraft returns toward Earth</li>
<li>Orion re-enters Earth’s atmosphere, descends under parachutes, and splashes 
down in the Pacific Ocean</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why are we going back to the Moon?</h2>

<p>Although humans have been to the Moon before, the total time we’ve spent 
there is only about 12 days. In such a short time, we have accomplished just a 
small fraction of the science that awaits us there. 
Although robotic missions have explored the Moon since the Apollo era, it’s 
still worth sending astronauts back. Humans can do science 
more quickly, flexibly, and intuitively than robots alone, especially 
when exploring complex terrain and selecting meaningful samples. 
The Moon also serves as a testing ground for technologies and skills that are 
needed for future deep-space missions, including eventual human trips 
to Mars.</p>
